  <h3><em>About me</em></h3>
  <p>
    As a lifelong learner i enjoy learning different subjects. I continue my
    learning today by engaging in nutrition, exercise, biochemistry, psychology,
    web design & coding (i built this website from scatch).
  <p>
    I use these skills to improve the lives of others via exercise/nutrition
    plans as well as my knowledge on circadian rhytmes to not only
    make a person healthier but instill good habits using proven science based
    methods.</p>
  My life goal is to experience life without the need for money, and help
  others attain the same goal. For this a person needs financial freedom, which
  is one of the main purposes i also study the market, and am a active investor.<br>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a class="exp" href="https://www.alamo.edu/">Alamo Colleges</a></strong> 2011-2016 <em>Exercise science</em></li>
    <ul>
      <li> <em>Here is where the the foundation was built of my real knowledge of nutriton, & exercise. I say real knowledge because
          ive actually been training/dieting since early in my life (about 8 years old),<br> so i had to correct my previous knowledge.</em></li>

      <li> <em>Texas state university is where my knowledge started to move to the next level. In a sense where
          i know i can self learn everything. <br> A biological/biochemical outlook enabled me to relate it to my exercise science background. <br>
          Taking classes about psychology, abnormal psychology as well as brain development helped me link the connections
          together.</em> </li>
